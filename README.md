git and local repository

working directory

dir where we initialize our git repo using "git init" command
git gonna keep track of changes of files in the working directory

Staging Area

"git add ." used to add the files to the staging area

local repository

through "git commit -m "msg" " the file is now in the local repository
so even if we messed up with the code we can revert to the
last version in our local repository
under version control through the "git checkout" command

git diff filename to find out the difference bw the saved version
and the last committed version of the file

git checkout filename revert to last committed version of the file 
in the local repository
